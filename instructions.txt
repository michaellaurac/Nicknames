Nicknames
Given is an array of string pairs. Every pair is a first name and a last name of a person. Your task is giving every person a unique nickname. A nickname of a person is either their first name, or their last name. To avoid any confusion, a person's nickname must not collide with neither a first name, nor a last name of any other person. For example, for the names:

Alan Appleseed, James Oliver, Oliver Twister

The following corresponding sequence of nicknames would be correct:

Alan, James, TwisterOption
